## 1. Introduction

This repository contains code and instructions for running a neonatal seizure detection deep learning algorithm using EEG signals as input and a probability of seizure trace as output.

<br /> It is based on the published papers [1] and [[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290015), and references are [below](#8-References).

## 2. Instructions for Use

The file to run the algorithm is [Main_Inference.py](Main_Inference.py).  
<br />  The probabilities of a seizure per second are output, per second of inputted EEG signal, in .npy format to the [Results](./Results) folder.
<br />  You can run this main file using as input the EEG files given with this repository which are from the Helsinki publicly available dataset [3]
and have been preprocessed as detailed below and as described in the paper  [1].
### EEG signal input file specifications
The input EEG files need to be in .mat format, a matrix of N by M, where N is the EEG signal data and M is the number of EEG channels in a bipolar montage.
The bipolar montage used, including order, in training and inference are given in [1] and [2], other bipolar configurations can be tested. 
<br /> EEG signal data should be at 32Hz sampling rate and during training was preprocessing by a DC notch filter and 0.5-12.8 bandwidth anti-aliasing filter.
### 2 Model variations
There are two different model variations (weights) given.  One that was trained on the publicly available Helsinki dataset [3] and a second that was trained on 
the Helsinki dataset plus the publicly available unannotated dataset [4] which was pseudo labelled by the authors using a novel technique fully described in [2].
For each of these training variations 3 runs were completed using three different random seeds.  Further details are given in [1].

### Adjustable parameters in [Main_Inference.py](Main_Inference.py)
These are the parameters that can be adjusted by the user and are situated at the top of [Main_Inference.py](Main_Inference.py) file.  The default values, used in training and inference, are also given here in the grey coloured rows.
